# The 🐥 Invasion

On May 17 2024 a mysterious item was found in the mountain, a 🐥 (a.k.a A Front Facing Baby Chick).
Soon after more were spotted in the desert and other locations.
Nearby players managed to collect a handful of them over the next few days.
But after May 20 2024 no more new 🐥's were found in p4nth3rworld.

Many have speculated where they came from and what happend to them.
One theory is that someone was tinkering with creating artificial items and lost control over their creations.

Whatever it may be, the few 🐥's that were adopted by players are being well taken care of.
