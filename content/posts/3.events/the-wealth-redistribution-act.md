title: The Wealth Distribution Act
---
The Wealth Distribution Act is the first act of p4nth3rworld!
It was enacted on the 12th of July 2024.

The Wealth Distribution Act is meant to take wealth from the wealthiest and distribute it back to the less wealthy. To prevent the wealthiest from becoming even wealthier.

The Act is as follows:
* When a person has more than 1000 wealth the following applies.
  * When the person tries to claim an item there is an chance that they will drop anywhere between 1 item and 10% of their inventory.
  * The chance is based on the players wealth and it increases exponentially.

The Act seems to have slowed down the wealth increase of the wealthiest somewhat, but we will have to wait and see how effective it is over a longer period of time.
