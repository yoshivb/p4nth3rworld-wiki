title: 'The Swamp Mystery'
---

On May 14 2024 there was a sudden occurence of a new location in p4nth3rworld called the Swamp.
In this location only irradiated, rotten and toxic items spawn, no other normal items.
People have been investigating this anomaly at their own risk but have yet to find any definitive cause.

So far it seems the issue is at least contained to the region with no signs of spreading.
